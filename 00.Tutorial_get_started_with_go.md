# Learn Go

## Get Started With Go Tutorial

https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/getting-started

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

- Declare a `main` package
  - A package is a way to group functions, and it's made up of all the files in the same directory.
- Import the popular `fmt` package, which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console. This package is one of the standard library packages you got when you installed Go.
- Implement a `main` function to print a message to the console. A `main` function executes by default when you run the `main` package.

Run your code to see the greeting

```go
go run .
Hello, World!
```

#### Call code in an external package

When you need your code to do something that might have been implemented by someone else, you can look for a package that has functions you can use in your code.

1. Make your printed message a little more interesting with a function from an external module
   - Visit pkg.go.dev and search for a "quote" package
   - Locate and click the `rsc.io/quote` package in search results (if you see rsc.io/quote/v3, ignore it for now).
   - On the Doc tab, under Index, note the list of functions you can call from your code. You'll use the `Go` function.
   - At the top of this page, note that package `quote` is included in the rsc.io/quote module.

You can use the pkg.go.dev site to find published modules whose packages have functions you can use in your own code. Packages are published in modules - like `rsc.io/quote` - where others can use them. Modules are improved with new versions over time, and you can upgrade your code to use the improved versions.

2. In your Go code, import the `rsc.io/quote`package and add a call to its `Go` function.
   - After adding the highlighed lines, youcode should include the following:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

import "rsc.io/quote"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(quote.Go())
}
```



3. Put your own code in a module for tracking dependencies.

- When your code imports packages from another module, a go.mod file lists the specific modules and version providing those packages. Tha file stays with your code, including in your sorce code respository.
- To create a go.mod file, run the `go mod init` command, giving the name of the module your code will be in (in this caes, just use "hello")

```go
$ go mod init hello
go: creating new go.mod: module hello
```

Run your code to see the message generated by the function you're calling.

```go
$ go run .
go: finding module for package rsc.io/quote
go: found rsc.io/quote in rsc.io/quote v1.5.2
Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating
```

Your code calls the `Go` function, printing a clever message about communication.

But before it ran the code, go `run` located and downloaded the `rsc.io/quote` module that contains the package you imported. By default, it downloaded the latest version - v1.5.2. Go build commands are designed to locate modules required for packages you import.
