// Go is an open source, compiled and statically typed programming language by Google.

// The key people behind the creation of Go are Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, and Robert Griesemer.

//  Go was made publicaly available in November 2009.

// One of the key areas where Go shines is the creation of highly available and scalable web apps.

// Go is a compiled language. The source code is compiled to a native binary. This is missing in interpreted languages such as JavaScript used in nodejs.
