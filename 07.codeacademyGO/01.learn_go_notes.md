## Codeacademy Learn Go Notes

- The `go run` command combines both the compliation and execution of code for us. THis allows us to quickly check the output of our code (and for any errors)
- `go build` creates an executable file in our current folder. `go run` does not.

#### Packages

- Every Go program starts with a package declaration.
- The package declaration informs the compiler whether to create an executable or a library.
- In contrast to an executable, a library doesn't outright run/execute code - it is a collection of code that can be used in other programs.
- Programs that have the package declaration `package main` will create an executable file.
- The `import` keyword allows us to bring in and use code from other packages.
- The package name is enclosed with double quotes "", otherwise we will get an error.
- Packages serve an important role in Go. They group related code together, allow code to be resuable, and make it easier to maintain. 
- We only import packages we need. Our programs run faster because it's not bogged down by extra code/packages.

#### Basic Go Structure: main

- The `func` keyword denotes the start of a function declaration.
- `func` is followed by the name of the function.
- After the name is a pair of parentheses () and a set of curly braces {}
- In other programming languages, functions have to be called, i/e/ told to run its code. However, a `main` function is special, a file that has a `package main` declaration will automatically run the `main` function!

#### Importing Multiple Packages

- A list of Go's standard packages: https://golang.org/pkg/
- You can provide an alias to a package by including the alias name before the file in your import statement.

#### Comments

- line comments are: `//`
- Block comments are `/*` `*/`

#### Go Resources

- Go has it's own built-in documentation system. To use it, in the command line, use the command `go doc` followed by a package name. For example `go doc fmt`. Or get specific infomration about a function in a package, for example `go doc time.Now`

#### Review Quiz

- When would building an executable file using `go build` be preferable to `go run`?
  - If the code is being used in production (users are interacting with it) then using an executable file is preferred. => Correct, rather than using `go run` multiple times, using `go build` once and executing the binary file is better for performance.
- What is the purpose of a library in Go?
  - A library is a Go package that won't create an executable file but contains code that we can use for our program. A library is a package that contains code that is not executed. It does not have the `package main` declaration.
- What is the importance of the package declaration: `package main`?
  - A package with the `package main` declaration will compile into an executable file.
- Fill in the code to import both the `fmt` and `math` packagew and alias `fmt` as `f`

```go
import (
	f "fmt"
	"math"
)
```

- What is the purpose of Go's compiler?
  - To translate Go code into binary code that computers understand.

#### Values and Variables

#### Literals

- Values can be numbers, like `109` or text wrapped in quotes, like`"Hello world"`. Thesevalues can be written into code as is, and are called literals. They are literally what they say they are.

#### Constants

- In addition to literal (aka unnamed) values, there are also named values. Naming a value in Go means creating a word that will represent that value. One example of named values are constants, which cannot be updated while the program is running.
- Another example of named values are variables which we can update their value.
- We use the `const` keyword to create a constant. We immediatley assign a value to the constant using a literal. Throughout the res of the program, we can use the constat's name instead of the literal.

#### Data Types

- Go has three basic categories for numbers:
  - Integers
  - Floating-point numbers
  - Complex numbers

#### Assigning Variables

- Variables are placeholder names that we use to refer to values that we intend to update over the course of our program.

#### Inferring Type

- There is a way to declare a variable without explicitly stating its type using the short declaration `:= `operator. We might use the `:=` operator if we know what value we want our value to store when creating it.
- Floats created with `:=` are of type `float64`
- Integers created with `:=` are either `int32` or `int64`
