## Tutorial Create a Go Module

### Start a modlue that others can use

Start by creating a Go module. In a module, you collect one or more related packages for a discrete and useful set of functions. For example, you might create a module with packages that have functions for doing financial analysis so that others writing financial applications can use your work.

Go code is grouped into packages, and packages are grouped into modules. Your package's module speciies the context Go needs to run the code, including the Go version and the set of other modules it requires.

As you add or improve functionality in your module, you publish new versions of the module. Developers writing code that calls functions in your module can import the module's updated packages and test with the new version before putting it into production use.

Start your module using the `go mod init` command to create a go.mod file.

	 - Run the `go mod init` command, giving it the path of the module your code will be in. Here, use `example.com/greetings` for the module path -- in production code, this would be the URL from which your module can be downloaded.

```go
$ go mod init example.com/greetings
go creating new go.mod: module example.com/greetings
```

The `go mod init` command creates a go.mod file that identifes your code as a module that might be used from other code. The file you just created includes only the name of your module and the Go version your code supports. But as you add dependencies -- meaning packages from other modules -- the go.mod file will list the specific module versions to use. This keeps builds reproducible and gives you direct control over which module versions to use.

In your text editor, create a file in which to write your code and call it greetings.go

Paste the following code into your greetings.go file and save the file

```go
package greetings

import "fmt"

// Hello returns a greeting for the named person.
func Hello(name string) string {
  // Return a greeting that embeds the name in a message.
  message := fmt.Sprintf("Hi, %v. Welcome!", name)
  return message
}
```

This is the first code for you module. It returns a greeting to any caller that asks for one. You'll write code that calls this function in the next step.

In this code, you:

- Declare a greetings package to collect related functions.
- Implement a `Hello` function to return the greeting.

This function takes a name parameter whose type is `string` , and returns a `string`. In Go, a function whose name starts with a capital letter can be called by a function not in the same package. This is known in Go as an *exported* name.
